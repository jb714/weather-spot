Thanks for checking out "The Weather Spot" -- an exercise in Frontend Development with React, and an inspiration to use Redux next time.

Please "npm install" in the app's root directory, and run npm start to run the server (in development it's served on localhost:3000)

**As of 2/16/2018, I have removed access to deployed version due to deprecation/rendering issue. I plan to investigate when I have time.**

**8/2019 update!! -- I'm going back and retooling the layout of this application using some CSS best practices I've picked up in my career thus far. I'm also giving consideration to making use of Redux for state management as well. Looking to redeploy soon :)**
