Thanks for checking out "The Weather Spot" -- an exercise in Frontend Development with React.

To see the app in action, visit https://weather-spot.herokuapp.com/ and be sure to hit "Yes" if prompted to share your location with the browser or to click the shield icon that has a red box in front of it ("Load unsafe scripts"). The browser detects an API (a completely haremless one) that uses geolocation to determine where you are currently accessing the app.
