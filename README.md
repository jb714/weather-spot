Thanks for checking out "The Weather Spot" -- an exercise in Frontend Development with React, and an inspiration to use Redux next time.

Please "npm install" in the app's root directory, and run npm start to run the server (in development it's served on localhost:3000)




The latest deployed version is here: https://weather-spot.herokuapp.com/
